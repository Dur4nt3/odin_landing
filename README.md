# Landing Page Project
### Landing Page Project | The Odin Project | Foundations

This is the second project within the "Foundations" course of "The Odin Project" [^1].

This project comes immediately after introducing "Flexbox" and it's main goal is creating a landing page using "Flexbox" [^2] [^3].

**Skills Demonstrated: Basic HTML, basic CSS, Flexbox.**

[^1]: The general design of the landing page was provided by "The Odin Project"; the implementation was done by me.

[^2]: This is a very basic project, at the point of creating this project, I still haven't learned about creating a responsive design that works well for mobile devices, therefore, the project will not look as intended on mobile device with a very narrow screen size; for the full, intended experience, I recommend viewing this on a desktop computer.

[^3]: Expect a more responsive landing page design in the future; if at the time of you viewing this there is non, there will be soon enough :wink:.
